Quickstart
----------

Cassowary is compatible with both Python 2 or Python 3. To install Cassowary
in your virtualenv, run::

    $ pip install cassowary

Then, in your Python code, you can create and solve constraint systems. See
`the documentation`_ for examples of what this looks like in
practice.
